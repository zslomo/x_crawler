# x_crawler
crawler for porhub
porhub require file  porn_hub_crawler.py only
-----
update:
xvideo script is no longer available  
addation: I push 3 new folds channel, playlist and star, now You can craw that three type videos by input the name which you interest in.  
These python files can be executed separately, and the file name is the series I crawed.   
it supports breakpoint resume , if there is a file disconnected, you only need to restart the script, and It will download automatic.  
  
Have fun !
